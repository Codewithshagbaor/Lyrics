# SongScripts - The LyricalBeast
This is a Django web application that uses the MusicMatch API to display lyrics for songs.

To use this application, you will need to have a MusicMatch API key, which can be obtained by registering for an account on the MusicMatch website. Once you have your API key, you can add it to the config.py file in the root directory of the application.

To run the application, you will need to have Django and Python installed on your machine. Once you have the required dependencies, you can navigate to the root directory of the application in the command line and run the following command:

Copy code

python manage.py runserver

This will start the development server and you can view the application by going to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your web browser.

To use the application, simply enter the name of a song and the artist in the search bar on the homepage and click the search button. This will display the lyrics for the song if they are available.

Please note that the MusicMatch API has certain usage limits and you may be restricted on how many queries you can make in a given time period.

The application is open-source and you can find the code on the GitHub repository.
